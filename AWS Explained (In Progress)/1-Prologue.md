# Prologue

This guide contains an informal explanation of CHS AWS Accounts and the context of why things are the way they are. I do my best to explain things assuming no knowledge of AWS, though I do assume that you have a basic understanding of things like Active Directory groups etc.

Please make suggestions by [opening an Issue here](https://code.chs.usgs.gov/bbushnell/bendocs/-/issues/new){target="_blank"}. If you're an advanced GitLib user, I invite you to fork bendocs and create a pull request with any changes you wish to see.
