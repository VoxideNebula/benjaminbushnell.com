# Reflections on my Career so far

A few months ago I surpassed the 5 year mark in my career. In response to this fact, I've reflected on what I've done so far, how I've grown, and what my trajectory might look like for the next few years. Unfortunately, many of the conclusions I came to about my career were grim. I don't know if 'normal' is a concept that can be applied to this situation, but it certainly *feels like*, normally, one would be happy to reach a milestone like this one. Unfortunately, happiness was not the emotion that I felt.
