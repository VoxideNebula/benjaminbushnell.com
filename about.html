    <h2>About</h2>
    <body>
        Benjamin Bushnell is a musician, storyteller, and IT specialist with the Federal Government (USGS Cloud Hosting Solutions).
        He grew up in Helena Montana where he was homeschooled until he graduated high school in 2015.
        He then attended Montana State University as a student of the Music technology program, but switched to Computer Science after the first year.
        He graduated in 2020 in the midst of the COVID pandemic and accepted a position with United States Geological Survey on the Cloud Hosting Solutions program, which is where he is currently employed.
        An avid learner, Benjamin picked up skills like writing, video editing, guitar, piano, sound design/editing, and music production alongside his curricular activities.
        In his free time, Benjamin likes to serve on the tech team at Revival church Bozeman, discuss how to live more like Jesus, play videogames, play tabletop games, write, and produce music (and of course write cheesy About web pages about, well... himself)
